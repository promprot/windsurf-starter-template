## 📋 Versioning

All documents must follow [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org/):
- **MAJOR** version for incompatible changes
- **MINOR** version for added functionality
- **PATCH** version for backwards-compatible bug fixes

## 📝 File Headers

Each document must begin with a standardized header:

```markdown
# Document Title

*Version: X.Y.Z*  
*Last Updated: YYYY-MM-DD*  
*Maintainer: Name/Team*
```

## 📅 Change Log

Each document must maintain a change log section at the bottom:

```markdown
## Changelog

### [X.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD
#### Added

## 📂 Naming Conventions

- Use `kebab-case` for all filenames
- Use descriptive, concise names
- Avoid special characters except hyphens and underscores
- Organize documentation in the following structure:
  ```
  docs/
  ├── architecture/     # High-level architecture decisions
  ├── api/             # API documentation
  ├── guides/          # How-to guides
  ├── reference/       # Technical reference
  └── standards/       # Documentation standards and guidelines
  ```

## 📝 Writing Style

- Use clear, concise language
- Use active voice
- Keep paragraphs short (2-3 sentences)
- Use bullet points for lists of items
- Use numbered lists for sequential steps
- Include code examples where applicable
- Use consistent terminology throughout all documentation

## 🔗 Cross-Referencing

- Link to related documents using relative paths
- Use descriptive link text
- Keep URLs up to date
- Use anchor links for long documents

## 🔒 Security Considerations

- Never include sensitive information
- Use placeholders for credentials or tokens
- Follow the principle of least privilege in examples
- Clearly mark any security-sensitive information

## 📊 Visual Elements

- Use Mermaid.js for diagrams
- Include alt text for images
- Keep diagrams simple and focused
- Use consistent styling across all visuals
- Ensure all visuals are accessible

## 📝 Review Process

1. Draft document in a feature branch
2. Self-review for clarity and accuracy
3. Request technical review from relevant team members
4. Address all feedback
5. Update version number following semantic versioning
6. Submit pull request for final review
7. Merge to main branch

## 📅 Review Schedule
